# 3.0 - Configuring the Lab Server
The steps in this section prepare the host for the lab by cloning a GitHub repository.

Current state assumption:
* The server has been updated to Ubuntu 18.04.2 (Kernel 4.20)
* The root account is permitted to logon via SSH

## Download and Install the remaining components
There are build scripts that perform many of the remaining steps for you. These scripts are only run one time and should NOT be run again unless the server has been rebuilt.

Logon to the host as root via SSH:
```
ssh root@<hostname>
```

1. Run the first build script to download the remaining files from the Internet.
```
cd ${git_base_path}
git pull
./scripts/step-1-download.sh
```
2. Run the second build script which unpacks and compiles the software.
```
${git_base_path}/scripts/step-2-build.sh
```
3. Reboot the server as directed by the script. This implements the changes to GRUB.
```
init 6
```


## Adjust the Global Variables
Logon to your lab server and customize the file `/etc/0-ovs-dpdk-global-variables.sh` to match the CPU core assignments for your server. Each server **WILL** be different. Make no assumptions about the CPU core IDs of the high performance cores, as they are set on a per-chip basis at the factory and cannot be modified.
Additionally, the server must have certain BIOS settings enabled to expose these cores. These BIOS instructions are not provided in this Git Repo at this time due to confidentiality.

The server is now ready for the lab exercise.


# Lab Server Configuration Completed!
The lab server is ready for the lab exercise. 
Please refer to the next guide in the `/docs` directory. The guide is entitled **"4.0 Running the Lab Exercise"**.
