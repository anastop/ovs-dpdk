# 3.0 - Configuring the Lab Server
The steps in this section prepare the host for the lab by cloning a GitHub repository.

Current state assumption:
* The server has been updated to Ubuntu 18.04.2 (Kernel 4.20)
* The root account is permitted to logon via SSH

## Download and Install the remaining components
There are build scripts that perform many of the remaining steps for you. These scripts are only run one time and should NOT be run again unless the server has been rebuilt.

Logon to the host as root via SSH:
```
ssh root@<hostname>
```

1. Run the first build script to download the remaining files from the Internet.
```
${git_base_path}/scripts/step-1-download.sh
```
2. Run the second build script which unpacks and compiles the software.
```
${git_base_path}/scripts/step-2-build.sh
```
3. Reboot the server as directed by the script. This implements the changes to GRUB.
```
init 6
```


# Final Setup
Edit the `/etc/0-ovs-dpdk-global-variables.sh` file to match the CPU core assignments for your server. Each server WILL be different. Make no assumptions about the CPU core IDs of the high performance cores.
Additionally, the server must have certain BIOS settings enabled to expose these cores. These BIOS instructions are not provided in this Git Repo at this time due to confidentiality.

The server is now ready for the lab exercise.
